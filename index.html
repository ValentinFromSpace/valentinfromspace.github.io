You've stumbled upon a tiny rock in a forest of great trees and occasional rainy weather. You look around and choose to explore further…</p><ul><li><a href="/about">More about me</a></li></ul><a href="/writing" class="paragraph-link"><h2>Blog</h2><p>I keep a sporadically updated blog. Right now I’m writing on the quiet side of cryptocurrency—the one you don’t hear about in the news.</p></a><a href="/writing" class="paragraph-link"><h2>Fiction</h2><p>Once every blue moon I get around to writing a story. I’ve published the first issue in the anthology <span class="small-caps">tales of outer space</span>.</p></a><h2>IC &amp; IPFS</h2><p>This website is hosted on <a href="https://ipfs.io/#how">IPFS</a>, the <span class="small-caps">interplanetary file system</span>. IPFS is a decentralized peer-to-peer network. Files are addressed via cryptographic hashes (content identifier or CID) rather than URLs. The downside of URLs is that they tell you where exactly something is located; CIDs on the other hand tell you what something is. Suppose someone tells you about a book. The other person didn't tell you the title of the book, but rather in which library you'll find it, and on exactly which shelf and row it is located. The library however is located on the other end of the planet and it would take you a long time to get there. And once you get there, you notice the library was renovated and the book is somewhere else entirely.</p><p>That's not how we communicate in real life, and it shouldn't be how we communicate on the web. Just like the other person tells you the title of the book so you can choose where you want to get the book yourself, you tell IPFS the hash of the file you want and the network will find the closest node that has your file. This happens to be a lot faster than the old way.</p><p>It is likely your browser got this website through a public IPFS gateway (in this case cloudflare-ipfs.com). If you instead want to be part of the the IPFS peer-to-peer network, visit my website on the <span class="small-caps">brave</span> browser and enable its native IPFS integration. Brave will then download an IPFS node to your device. You can now fetch this website directly from my node.</p><p>I'm also looking to get this website running on the <span class="small-caps">internet computer</span>. The <a href="https://dfinity.org/faq">IC</a> is a web of globally distributed nodes that execute "canisters". A canister is a smart-contract, but much more capable. Canisters include both code and persistent state.</p><h2>Thanks</h2><p>This website was built on the shoulders of giants.</p><ul><li>John Sundell, creator of <a href="https://github.com/johnsundell/publish">Publish</a> (static site generator) and hundreds of insightful articles on Swift.</li><li>Matthew Butterick, creator of <a href="https://practicaltypography.com">Practical Typography</a> and Valkyrie, the font you’re reading right now.</li><li>Sofia Mohr, designer of Moranga, the font used for headings throughout this website.</li><li>All the photographers who generously contributed their works to Unsplash.
