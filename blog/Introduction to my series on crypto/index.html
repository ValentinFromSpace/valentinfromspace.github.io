Most will only know Bitcoin, as it is the most covered crypto in the news and general conversation. There's so much more to this space than Bitcoin. I want to introduce you to some of the basic concepts and then show the incredible innovation that has happened in the decade following Bitcoin's inception.</p><p>I want to be very clear that crypto is still just a ton of speculation. There is zero to no utility. This is a space that hasn't even hatched yet—but it's close to.</p><h2 id="a-brief-history">A brief history</h2><p>Early version of some of Bitcoin's technology had been floating around for a few decades before Bitcoin's white paper was published in late 2008. Satoshi Nakamoto's genius invention was designing a system that can reach global consensus on a distributed ledger, all while preventing the infamous double-spend. Digital files can be duplicated at the touch of a finger, so how do we prevent the duplication of virtual currency without a centralized authority keeping track?</p><p>Ethereum was the next fundamental step. It was first proposed in 2013 by Vitalik Buterin. Ethereum's paradigm shift was introducing smart-contracts: computer programs that can be trustlessly executed between two parties. This fueled an explosion in cryptocurrencies, as creators were able to emulate tokens using smart-contracts to benefit their applications.</p><p>Since then it has been a race to scale these protocols to actual utility. Notable evolutions include Cardano, Polkadot, Dfinity, Algorand, Tezos—just to name a few, each one brining new solutions to the table.</p><h2 id="cryptology-making-the-intangible-tangible">Cryptology — making the intangible tangible</h2><p>Put simply: magic. Cryptography is the branch of mathematics that makes the intangible digital space tangible. It allows for proof of ownership, secure identity and private communication. You're using it right now: If you take a look at your browser's search field right now, you might notice a lock icon. This lock indicates the connection to the website you're viewing is taking place over the <code>https</code> protocol. This protocol is designed to eliminate "man in the middle attacks". Specifically, it's implemented using public-key cryptography.</p><p>Public-key cryptography is the most important primitive. It's essentially magic; allowing you to establish end-to-end encrypted communication channels in the open. This is done by having every participant hold on to two keys: one private, one public.</p><p>Alice can now encrypt her message with Bob's public key. Bob can then decrypt that message using his private key. This is the fundamental building block. With it, much more advanced systems can be built, but the idea remains the same.</p><img src="/img/blog/public-key_cryptography.jpg" alt="Public-key cryptography infographic"/><p>Another important primitive is hashing. It's commonly called a one-way function, because once you hash something, you can't get it back. Say you hashed the word "Hello!". You would get a character-salad <code>n</code> characters long. Say someone else hashed the entire Lord of the Rings trilogy—that person too would get an <code>n</code>-long character salad. One might compare this to fingerprints: you can identify someone with a fingerprint provided you know which fingerprint belongs to who, but you can't construct a person just by looking at the fingerprint.</p><h2 id="proofs-reaching-global-consensus">Proofs — reaching global consensus</h2><p>You've definitely heard this one before: the Blockchain. Very simply, a blockchain is a simple enough database that thousands—hopefully millions—of nodes around the globe can reach consensus on. This simplicity also guarantees a high level of security. At some point, a <em>genesis</em> block is introduced. It denotes the first state of the chain. Then, whenever the protocol wants to, a new block is appended. This is important: a blockchain is append-only. Once it's on the blockchain, it's immutable.</p><p>But a currency would be a pretty lousy one if only one entity had the control (right…?). So how do millions of people around the globe agree on something as contentious as money and property?</p><p>This is the consensus mechanism. You might have heard of one before: Proof of Work. It's what Bitcoin uses. A Bitcoin miner has to compute a number under a certain threshold to win a block. That number has to be computed by hashing the miner's public key and some information about the block. The resulting hash is then interpreted as a hexadecimal number. If that number isn't under the threshold, a "nonce" is thrown into the mix—essentially just an incremental number to make the hashing algorithm return a different result. This is repeated over an over again, until someone is lucky enough to find the number. The miner then gossips the numbers he used to get to the lucky number. Others will then validate that it is indeed correct and eventually include the block in their own local copy of the chain.</p><p>This is extremely energy expensive and Bitcoin's particular algorithm can be gamed using ASICs (application specific integrated circuits). The immense energy usage also leads to consolidation of miners within locations that have cheaper energy prices. So if Bitcoin's consensus mechanism is so energy intensive, slow and not favorable of decentralization, why is it so popular? You tell me.</p><p>There do exist alternatives. The thing about consensus mechanisms is that they are designed to tolerate Byzantine fault up to a certain threshold. There's always going to be a certain fraction of bad actors and the system has to work with them in mind. You also want fair distribution of block rewards.</p><p>So what you do is take some scarce resource and make people proof they have it. In the case of Bitcoin that scarcity is guaranteed by energy and computation. Modern approaches include Proof of Stake, where block producers have a higher chance if they have more of the currency. It gets even more utilitarian with Filecoin, a protocol that creates peer-to-peer storage markets uses Proof of Spacetime, where miners proof they have a certain amount of storage available on the markets, and again, the more they the higher the chance of them winning blocks.</p><h2 id="smart-contracts-unbounded-potential">Smart-contracts — unbounded potential</h2><p>For a while, blockchains were pretty much capped in terms of functionality and utility. They were essentially only distributed ledgers that allowed for money transfer.</p><p>Then came Ethereum and introduced smart-contracts. They are small-ish computer programs that can be executed in a trustless manner between multiple participants.</p><p>Say you want to trade one currency for another with some random stranger. You could set up up some kind of escrow maintained by a trusted authority—essentially an exchange. Or you could use smart-contracts. You upload the code to the blockchain where it is immutably stored, trustlessly executed and validated.</p><p>This is powerful. The possibilities here are endless. Anyone can build anything. Just like there is an endless amount of creativity in web/desktop/mobile apps, there will be endless creativity in blockchain apps.</p><h2 id="on-safari-spectating-actual-wildlife">On safari — spectating actual wildlife</h2><p>Let's have a look at the current environment of cryptocurrencies. What can be built already? Is there a something the average person can benefit from now?</p><p>I would argue there is hardly any utility to be found. The whole experience is hostile towards casual users. You and you alone are responsible for your private keys. Lose them and you will never see your wallet again. There are thousands of clones, copies and flat out scams. As long as this is the case, crypto will remain in the realm of speculation and uncertainty.</p><h3 id="cardano">Cardano</h3><p>Cardano is all about fundamental research. They're not afraid to spend the time it takes to develop the most powerful programmable ledger on Earth. They have a strong focus on Africa. This is where cryptocurrency can have the most meaningful impact. In March 2021 they revealed a monstrous deal in Ethiopia that has been in the works for half a decade. Five million students will get an identity issued on the Cardano blockchain to keep their credentials safe.</p><p>Cardano runs on proof-of-stake. Future optimizations are said to scale the network to handle millions of transactions per second.</p><h3 id="internet-computer">Internet Computer</h3><p>The IC is the next evolution in smart-contracts. They call their version "canisters". Canisters can run indefinitely and have persistent state. IC nodes are powerful machines built to execute canisters efficiently.</p><p>The Internet Computer's native token is called <code>ICP</code>. It's used for governance of the network. ICP can be burned in exchange for <code>Cycles</code>, a token that is algorithmically stable over the long term. It is pegged to the International Monetary Fund's <code>SDR</code>: a conceptual currency based on all of the world's major fiat currencies.</p><p>The IC also features a promising concept of identity. Users can register their identity on the network and secure it via either biometrics like the iPhone's Face ID or security keys like the Yubikey. No need to remember passwords or private keys!</p><h3 id="filecoin">Filecoin</h3><p>Filecoin is a specialized blockchain designed to facilitate storage markets. Its consensus mechanism is coupled with the fundamental utility of the protocol: storage. The more storage a miner has, the more likely it is to win blocks.</p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>The crypto craze fulfills some of the internet's earliest promises: peer-to-peer connectivity and ubiquitous composability. I hope to have shown you the immense creativity and possibility of cryptocurrencies. Regardless of ideologies expressed or stigmas circulated by others.</p><p>The spirit of crypto instills me with a warm feeling of hope and excitement.</p><hr><h1 id="introduction-to-cryptocurrencies">Introduction to cryptocurrencies</h1><p>I've written this introduction for those who have heard about cryptocurrencies only in the news and probably only about Bitcoin. If this is you, I would love to introduce you to the quieter side of crypto. The side that builds and ships every day and will ultimately prevail.</p><p>Bitcoin has comfortably been the number one cryptocurrency since its inception. Since then, it has sparked a multi-trillion dollar space of innovation. The invention of Bitcoin may proof to be the single most important event of the century. The legend of Satoshi Nakamoto will echo for centuries still. But Bitcoin is not the endgame. While it has sparked incredible innovation, it has not fundamentally solved any of its properties. Bitcoin hasn't solved governance. Bitcoin hasn't solved scalability (by a long shot). It has not solved decentralization. And crucially, it is useless beyond its simple transfer and storage capabilities.</p><p>Still, it has the most vocal community and is by far the most known cryptocurrency. Bitcoin has transitioned from challenger to incumbent. I need not remind you that this as fresh and unproven as it gets. First mover advantage means nothing. Utility is non-existent. The only thing that matters right now, is to build That aside, this piece is not a criticism of the incumbents, rather it is a celebration of the new challengers.</p><p>One question to those who believe Bitcoin is the end all, be all: Do you think that one person could have fundamentally solved money for all of eternity and subsequently nullified all further research and years of work by thousands of other people?</p><p>No.</p><h2 id="cryptography-making-the-intangible-tangible">Cryptography — making the intangible tangible</h2><p>Put simply: magic. Cryptography is the branch of mathematics that makes the seemingly intangible digital space tangible.</p><p>The most important primitive is public-key cryptography. This is when one person holds two keys: one private, one public.</p><p><strong>TOC</strong> - Cryptography — making the intangible tangible (put simply: magic) - Proofs of… — reaching global consensus - Smart Contracts — unbounded potential - On safari — spectating actual wildlife	- Gives some real world examples</p><hr><p>Bitcoin is a screaming hot mess. Prices surging to a trillion dollar market capitalization. Tesla accepting it as payment option. People calling for it to be the world reserve currency. With news jumping at this unknown phenomenon and the deafening noise coming from the Bitcoin community, you have no doubt heard all this before.</p><p>Less likely is that you've heard of the quieter side of crypto. The side that will ultimately prevail. We will be eternally grateful for Bitcoin. Every single crypto currency stands on the shoulder of this ancient behemoth. The legend of Satoshi Nakamoto will echo for centuries still. Without the original white paper from 2008, society would be in a dimmer place.</p><p>Bitcoin was the first step—an infinitely big step—yet still just the first. Bitcoin hasn't solved governance. Bitcoin hasn't solved scalability. And Bitcoin hasn't solved decentralization. Bitcoin has transitioned from challenger to incumbent. Let me direct the spotlight at the quieter side of crypto currencies. Specifically, we will explore the realm of cryptography through three projects: Cardano, Dfinity and Filecoin. All three are unique to each other and provide fresh new approaches.</p><p>Next time we will look at the consensus mechanisms of Cardano, Dfinity and Filecoin and how they relate to Bitcoin.</p><h2 id="glossary">Glossary</h2><p>A short glossary you can come back to throughout the series.</p><h4 id="blockchain">Blockchain</h4><p>A chain of "blocks" that each reference the hash of its predecessor, making it impossible to change one without changing every successor.</p><h4 id="hashing">Hashing</h4><p>Converting an arbitrarily large amount of data to a fixed size number.
